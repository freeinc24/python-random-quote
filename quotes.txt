A few notes:
 * scikit-learn:  The import from sklearn.preprocessing means you need the scikit-learn package.
 * pysolana: The import from solana.rpc.api suggests you are using the pysolana library.
 * solders: The imports from solders.pubkey and from solders.compute_budget mean you need to install the solders crate for Solana.
 * spl-token: The imports from spl.token.client and other spl.token related lines indicate that you need this library.
 * No explicit json or time:  These are part of Python's standard library, so they don't need to be in requirements.txt.
 * Logging: The logging module is also part of Python's standard library.
To install these, you would use:
pip install -r requirements.txt
